# demo-state-machine
proof of concept spring boot application

## Details

This repo is just a small project to illustrate fundamental data transfer concepts in spring boot. 
It uses core spring libraries in addition to h2 to host an in-memory database when the project is built. It also leverages Vavr in a few places. 

## Build and Run

You can run `docker-compose up` and access it at `localhost:8080`.
You can also just build and run the docker file directory. 
Or you can run `./mnvw spring-boot:run` to spin the project locally.
